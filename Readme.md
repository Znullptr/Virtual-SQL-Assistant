## 🗄️ Targeted Database

This AI chatbot is currently configured to work with the **`bikesdb`** dataset — a sample **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)** database used for business analytics and reporting.

You can explore and download the `bikesdb` from this link:  
👉 [Download bikesdb MSSQL Sample DB](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/getting-started/load-sample-database)

> 💡 **Want to use your own MSSQL database?**  
Simply replace the `ddls.json` and `examples.json` files located in the `Data/` folder with your own schema and question-answer examples. This will allow the chatbot to understand and interact with your specific database structure.
